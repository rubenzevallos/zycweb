= bin/modify.php =

This script can be used to modify an existing mtrack instance.  You should try
to use the administration interface where possible.

== Synopsis ==

{{{
% cd $MTRACK
% php bin/modify.php ...parameters...
}}}

== Parameters ==

=== --repo !{name} !{type} !{repopath} === #repo

Adds a source repository.  This works in the same way as the
[help:bin/Init#repo repo option for bin/init.php].

=== --link !{project} !{repo} !{location} === #link

Defines a link between the project identified by short name !{project} and the
repository named !{name} by the source location identified by the regex
!{location}.

=== --trac !{project} !{tracenv} === #trac

Imports data from a the trac environment on the local filesystem at !{tracenv}, and associate it with the project named !{project}.

This works in the same way as the
[help:bin/Init#trac trac option for bin/init.php],
''except that the trac imports will always be treated as
secondary instances''.  This means that the tickets and wiki pages will all be
prefixed with the project name.

=== --config-file !{filename} === #config-file

Where to find the pre-existing configuration file.

If not specified, defaults to {{{config.ini}}} in the mtrack directory.

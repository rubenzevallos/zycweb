= MTrackCaptcha_Recaptcha =

When used in a public facing environment, in order to reduce automated spam,
you may want to enable a CAPTCHA.  Mtrack has an API that allows different
captcha implementations to be used, and ships with support for the reCaptcha
service.

== configuration ==

The plugin is loaded by adding a line like the following to your [help:ConfigIni config.ini]:

{{{
[plugins]
MTrackCaptcha_Recaptcha = publickey, privatekey, userclass
}}}

The first parameter is your publickey key and the second is your privatekey.
You can obtain keys from [http://recaptcha.net/api/getkey?app=mtrack recaptcha.net].

The userclass parameter indicates which classes (separated by a pipe character)
of user should have the captcha applied.  The default value is
{{{anonymous|authenticated}}} which means that everyone except for admin users
will be presented with a captcha.

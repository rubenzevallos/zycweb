                Welcome to MyWebCareer!  We are glad that you’ve decided to sign up and check out our website (www.mywebcareer.com) and services that we offer.  But before you do, you must agree to be bound by these terms and conditions of use set forth below.              
            </p>
            <p>
                We strongly encourage you to read in full these terms of use before subscribing to our service.  We present below a brief summary in non-legal terms to guide you through the document:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        MyWebCareer is for personal use only.

                    <p>
                        We do our best to retrieve and display data that is relevant to you. We are however not perfect and nor are the technologies we use. We may sometimes mistakenly identify data as relating to your career and we may miscalculate your Career Score as a result. Let us know if this happens and we’ll do our best to fix it!

                        Our patent-pending Career Scoring algorithm is our trade secret. Don’t ask us to tell you exactly how it works as we’ll have to respectfully refuse. We will provide guidance to our premium subscribers on factors that influence their score but will never disclose in full how the scoring algorithm works.

                <strong>Permissible Use & Subscription to our Services</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                MyWebCareer Inc. provides online services to enable registered users of the services to discover and evaluate online data that may relate to their career. MyWebCareer is for individual, consumer use only and is intended to enable the consumer to discover and evaluate data that relates to them personally.             
            </p>
            <p>
                You may not use the MyWebCareer services to discover and evaluate information that relates to 3rd parties (anyone other than you personally). This restriction does not include data that the services make available about your business and social network associates and that is derived from public open source searches or from your business and social network data you grant us access to. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The MyWebCareer service is for personal use only. Use of the MyWebCareer Services for employee background screening, candidate screening, researching employee or job candidate background or online behavior is strictly prohibited and constitutes a breach of these terms of use. You may not use the service for any activity that is governed by the Fair Credit Reporting Act in the United States or any other similar or equivalent legislation in countries or territories outside of the United States. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A user may only register or sign-up once with MyWebCareer.  By accepting these terms and conditions, you certify that you personally have only signed up once for our service.  Furthermore, you certify to provide accurate, current and complete information about you as part of our registration process and keep it updated as needed; maintain your username and password in a secure manner; and bear full responsibility for all use of your account and actions associated with it. 
            </p>
            <p>
                By signing up for our service and if you choose to authorize us to pull content from third parties, you automatically grant, represent and warrant that you have the right to the data contained therein and grant the Company to use, copy, reformat, translate, excerpt (in whole or in part) and distribute such content for any purpose as directed by you.  You may remove such content from our site at any time.  We do not assert any ownership over content we pulled on you rather, as between us and you, subject to the rights granted to us in these Terms, you retain full ownership of all of your User Content and any intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights associated with your User Content.
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>
                <strong>MyWebCareer Content and Accuracy</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                MyWebCareer is a data aggregator. We use data that you provide to us during registration to federate searches against third party data providers. Although we do our best to ensure that the data we return and display is relevant, due to the nature of the content, it is impossible for us to guarantee this. 
            </p>
            <p>
                MyWebCareer services are intended to be used as a tool to help in the discovery and evaluation of online data that may relate to your career. Due to the nature of Internet content and the difficulty of specifically identifying unique individuals referenced in the content, you should consider MyWebCareer a time-saving tool that runs online searches against a number of providers on your behalf. As with searches you may manually run on Internet search engines, the results returned may or may not relate or be relevant to you. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, we utilize automated entity extraction technologies to attempt to identify references to entities with the content we return. As most of our data providers return “search abstracts” and not complete pages, our entity extraction may sometimes be inaccurate or incomplete. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The MyWebCareer Service will generate a Career Score for you. Your Career Score is intended to be indicative of the strength of your Professional Online Brand based upon data you provided and data we were able to retrieve that may relate to you. By default, your Career Score is available only to you, we do not share, sell or otherwise make available your Career Score to any third parties. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Your Career Score is provided to you on an “as-is” basis. We make no warranties, guarantees or representation about the accuracy of your Career Score or its fitness for any particular purpose. It is intended for use as guidance on the possible strength or weakness of your Professional Online Brand only.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your Career Score is generated using scoring algorithms that are the intellectual property of MyWebCareer Inc. We reserve the right to alter and improve these scoring algorithms as and when we see fit. By accepting these terms of use, you acknowledge and accept that the scoring algorithms and methods used to generate your Career Score are the sole property of MyWebCareer Inc. and you release us from any and all obligations to publish or otherwise make public any details relating to the functioning of these scoring algorithms.

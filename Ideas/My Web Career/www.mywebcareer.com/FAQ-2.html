<strong><a name="1">What is MyWebCareer?</a></strong><br />
Based in Northern Virginia, MyWebCareer was founded in January 2010 with a mission to help consumers manage their professional online brand.  We produce a FICO-like Career Score to help consumers easily assess the strength of their Professional Online Brand.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong><a name="2">What is a Professional Online Brand?</a></strong><br />
A Professional Online Brand is a cohesive image that can lead you to be positioned as a trusted expert in your field.  References to you on corporate websites, blog posts, press releases, and social or business network profiles build your digital footprint and create an online presence.  Collectively, career-specific data in these footprints make up your Professional Online Brand.  Your Professional Online Brand can attract the ideal employer or client and convey to them the value of investing in you.  
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
<strong><a name="3">Why is my Professional Online Brand important?</strong><br /></a>
Potential and existing employers, work colleagues, recruiters and business partners increasingly utilize Internet search engines as well as social & business networks to research your career and personal background.  Information that can be located about you online may affect how you, your career claims, and achievements are perceived.  According to CareerBuilder.com, over 59% of recruiters and hiring managers are influenced by your digital footprint, and one in five of them use social networking sites to research job candidates.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
<strong><a name="4">How much does MyWebCareer cost?</strong><br /></a>
The core MyWebCareer service is completely free and will always remain so.  MyWebCareer Premium is currently under development with pricing to be determined.    
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
<strong><a name="5">Why must I have a LinkedIn or Facebook profile to use MyWebCareer?</strong><br /></a>
LinkedIn is synonymous with business networking while Facebook is with personal networking.  Instead of asking you to create and remember yet another username and password, we allow you to sign-up using either LinkedIn or Facebook.  We also utilize employment history details listed in your LinkedIn and Facebook profiles to generate searches and build your Professional Online Brand.  Completeness of these profiles is a significant factor in the calculation of your Career Score.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
<strong><a name="6">What is a Career Score?</strong><br /></a>
We've developed Career Score, a patent-pending numerical representation of the strength of your Professional Online Brand.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
<strong><a name="7">How is my Career Score calculated?</strong><br /></a>
Our sophisticated scoring algorithm examines over 130 factors of your Professional Online Brand in calculating your Career Score.  
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
<strong><a name="8">How often is my Career Score updated?</strong><br /></a>
We update your Career Score once a month and notify you of any changes.  Additionally, you are granted two update tokens to manually update it anytime you like.   
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
<strong><a name="9">Who can see my Career Score?</strong><br /></a>
By default, your Career Score is only available to you.  You may choose to share it by making your profile publicly available or by sharing with your LinkedIn connections and/or Facebook friends.    
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
<strong><a name="10">Can an employer or potential employer access my Career Score?</strong><br /></a>
By default, your Career Score is only available to you.  You may choose to share it by making your profile publicly available.  We do not share, sell or otherwise make available your data to third parties.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
<strong><a name="11">What if I have a low Career Score?  How do I improve my Career Score?</strong><br /></a>
Your Career Score is a numerical representation of the strength of your Professional Online Brand. A low Career Score indicates that you may need to work on improving your positive online exposure.  You can accomplish this through simple actions such as removing any negative sentiment from your Facebook page or connecting with people you’ve worked with on LinkedIn. The Score Guidance page features actionable analytics on factors that negatively affected your score with guidance on how to improve it.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
<strong><a name="12">I don’t agree with my Career Score, what can I do?</strong><br /></a>
Send us an e-mail at feedback@mywebcareer.com with an explanation as to why you disagree with your Career Score.  We will conduct an internal assessment and provide you a response within three business days.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
<strong><a name="13">What is the Deep Web?</strong><br /></a>
The Deep Web (also called Deepnet, the invisible Web, dark Web or the hidden Web) refers to World Wide Web content that is not part of the Surface Web, which is indexed by standard search engines.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
<strong><a name="14">Can I edit, delete or change data that appears in my digital footprint reports on MyWebCareer?</strong><br /></a>
No, MyWebCareer does not offer Internet destroy, Internet removal or search optimization services.  You can affect the data that comprises your Professional Online Brand by taking simple actions on your Business or Social Network accounts.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
<strong><a name="15">How can I access MyWebCareer from my iPad, iPhone or other mobile device?</strong><br /></a>
MyWebCareer currently utilizes flash-based components for our charting and score metrics features. These features will not work on an iPhone or iPad as Apple does not support Flash.  However, all other features available on MyWebCareer can be accessed. We are working on an alternative implementation of these features that will utilize HTML5 which is supported on these devices.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
<strong><a name="16">Who owns MyWebCareer?</strong><br /></a>
MyWebCareer is privately owned and funded by the founders. We are based in the Northern Virginia area in the United States.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
<strong><a name="17">What if I have a question that is not answered in this FAQ?</strong><br /></a>

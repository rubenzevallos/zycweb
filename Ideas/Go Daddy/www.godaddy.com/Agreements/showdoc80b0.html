<p>Go Daddy shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide you with accurate daily estimates of the revenue your website generates.

Additionally, in calculating your Commission Payment, amounts may include fractions of a cent. Go Daddy shall use commercially reasonable efforts to round these amounts to the nearest cent in a manner so as to benefit you. However, you acknowledge and agree that in calculating your Commission Payment Go Daddy's determination regarding the same shall be the final and binding determination. Upon your cancellation of the Services, you acknowledge and agree that Go Daddy has the right to charge you the lesser of (i) $15.00 or (ii) the unpaid funds remaining in your CashParking account as an "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Administrative Fee</span>" in connection with your cancellation of the Services. Any funds remaining in your CashParking account after the deduction of the Administrative Fee shall be paid to you in accordance with your selected payment option.</p>
<p><strong class="heading1"><strong>6</strong>. payment of Commission Payments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Direct Deposit</strong></p>
<p>Direct deposit is available only to domestic CashParking Customers (CashParking Customers based in the U.S.).&nbsp; Domestic CashParking Customers utilizing direct deposit will be paid Commission Payments to the U.S. bank account of their choice (&ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Direct Deposit Account</span>&rdquo;). You understand it is your responsibility to provide a valid U.S. bank account number and the related direct deposit information by signing into the Go Daddy Control Center. Failure to provide a valid Direct Deposit Account will cause your Commission Payments to be withheld pending receipt by Go Daddy of proper direct deposit instructions. You can find the instructions on how to set up a Direct Deposit Account at any time by clicking on the &ldquo;Payment Information&rdquo; link from your home page on the Go Daddy Control Center.</p>
<p>Domestic CashParking Customers hereby authorize Go Daddy to initiate and post credit (positive) entries for Commission Payments to the Direct Deposit Account. Domestic CashParking Customers understand the amount initiated and posted to the Direct Deposit Account on a monthly basis will represent payment for commissions earned in the preceding second month, less any applicable fees and/or charge backs. For example, commissions earned in January 2010 would be paid by March 15, 2010.

Direct deposit transactions will be initiated on the 15th day of each month or if the 15th falls on a non-banking day, then direct deposit transactions will be initiated the next banking day.

			<img border="0" class="ccm-image-block" alt="" src="../files/6412/8335/7672/terms-of-use-title.gif" width="670" height="41" /><p>Please read the following Terms of Use carefully because they apply  to  your access to and use of the Web Site and Services and constitute a   legally binding agreement between you and Agent Anything, Inc.&nbsp; Clicking the "I Agree" button constitutes your acceptance to be bound by  these Terms of Use.&nbsp; If you do not accept all of the terms of this  Agreement, you will not be able to use the Services.<em> </em></p>
<p><em>In this document, please note that &ldquo;The Company&rdquo; refers to Agent Anything Inc., and, where  appropriate, both Agent Anything Inc. and its affiliates; and that &ldquo;The Services&rdquo; refers to the services provided by the Company, including the Web Site and any forums, bulletin board services, chat  areas, message boards, news groups, information, images, text and/or  other message or communication facilities designed to allow you to  communicate with the Internet community or with a group on the Web Site  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">(Please note that this does not include services provided by  the Agents)</span>;</em><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>1. AGENT ANYTHING</strong></p>
<p>This Web Site (www.agentanyting.com) acts only as a venue at which   Clients and Agents may  connect with each other.&nbsp; The Services of  Agent Anything Inc. consist only of enabling a this connection, providing a  framework for and facilitating business agreements between the two  parties, and providing technical support to users of its Web Site.</p>
<p>The  Company is not in any way involved or implicated in the actual agreement  between Agent and Client. &nbsp;The Company does not endorse or support any  Agents or Clients.&nbsp; The Company makes no claim of having direct  knowledge about any Agents or Clients, nor does it necessarily know any  Agents or Clients personally.&nbsp; The Company does not guarantee the truth  or accuracy of any user&rsquo;s identity or posts.&nbsp; The Company does not have  control over the quality, timing, legality, failure to provide services,  or any other aspect whatsoever of the services provided by the Agents.&nbsp;  The Company cannot and does not control whether or not Agents will  complete the Missions they accept nor can the Company force an Agent to  perform a Mission.&nbsp; Similarly, the Company cannot and does not control  whether or not Clients pay the Agents who perform their Missions, nor  can the Company force a Client to pay for a Mission.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Company will not be liable for the conduct of Clients and Agents or any claim, injury, damage, or cost of procurement of replacement goods and services arising in connection with your use of the service.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. CLIENTS</strong></p>
<p>Clients are users of the Services that can post Missions to be performed.&nbsp; Anyone over the age of 18 with a valid credit card wishing to have Missions completed may become a Client</p>
<p>Clients may post Missions to the Web Site for Agents to see, accept and accomplish.&nbsp; All Clients must submit their credit card information (card number,    billing address, etc.) in order to award a Mission to an Agent.&nbsp; For any accomplished Mission, Clients must pay the Agent's Reward, applicable Reimbursements (defined below) and Agent Anything's fee, which is based on the amount of the Reward and any Reimbursements processed by the Company.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. AGENTS</strong></p>
<p>Agents are users of the Services that can accept and perform Missions.&nbsp; Any student with a valid university e-mail address may become an Agent.&nbsp; Upon signing up to be an Agent, the Company will send a confirmation e-mail to the university e-mail address provided by the Agent. Upon validation of this e-mail address, the Agent is free to accept Missions on the Web Site.&nbsp; If the university email address expires or is no longer is valid for any reason, the Agent may not continue for perform Missions.</p>
<p>Agents are independently responsible for paying all taxes associated with the Missions they perform for Clients.&nbsp; Agents are not agents or employees of the Company. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employer-employee relationship is created by use of the Services.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. MISSIONS</strong></p>
<p>Missions are errands, tasks, chores or any other services requested by Clients on the Web Site.&nbsp; Missions are agreements directly between the Client and the Agent.&nbsp; The  Company is not a party to such agreements.&nbsp; As such, the Company will  not be liable for the actions of the Agents or Clients, the failure of  Missions or the failure to pay for them.</p>
<p>a) Posting a Mission</p>
<p>A request for the performance of an errand, task, chore or any other service is made by posting a Mission to the Web Site. All Missions posted must be for legal activities and are subject to   these terms.</p>
<p>The Company reserves the right, but does not assume any  responsibility,  to (a)&nbsp;remove any material posted on the Web Site which  the Company,  in its sole discretion, deems inconsistent with the  foregoing  commitments, including any material the Company has been  notified, or  has reason to believe, constitutes a copyright infringement  or any  Mission that constitutes an illegal activity, and (b) reformat, excerpt   or translate any content submitted.&nbsp; Accordingly, the Company is not   responsible for monitoring Missions to ensure their legality, and the   Company will not be liable for any illegal Missions.</p>
<p>b) Rewards</p>
<p>The Reward is the price paid by the Client to the Agent for the successful completion of a Mission.&nbsp; All Missions posted will indicate either (i) a specified Reward amount that the Client will be bound to pay to any Agent who completes a Mission, or (ii) that the Client is willing to accept offers from Agents.</p>
<p>If the Client specifies the Reward associated with a Mission, the Client will be bound to pay the specified amount to the Agenut upon successful completion of the Mission.&nbsp; If the Client elects to accept offers from Agents, the Client may accept any or none of the amounts offered by Agents for completion of the Mission.&nbsp; Once the Client accepts an offer, the Client is bound to pay the offer price to the Agent upon successful completion of the Mission.</p>
<p>The Reward amount will be charged to the Client's credit card by the Company.</p>
<p>c) Reimbursements</p>
<p>Agents must be reimbursed by the Client for any expenses that the Client asked the Agent to incur during the completion of a Mission.&nbsp; Transportation expenses, or any other expenses incurred by the Agent but not requested by the Client are not reimbursable.&nbsp; For example, if the Client asks the Agent to purchase groceries, the price of the groceries must be reimbursed.&nbsp; If the Agent decides to take a taxi to deliver these groceries, the price of the taxi is not to be reimbursed (unless specifically indicated by the Client).</p>
<p>The Client must indicate, in the publicly-viewable portion of the  Mission description, whether his or her Mission requires the Agent to  spend money of his or her own, subject to reimbursement by the Client.&nbsp; If the Mission does require the Agent to spend  money, the Client must estimate the amount of money that will be spent and indicate how this expense will be reimbursed.</p>
<p>Reimbursements can be made in cash or by credit card.&nbsp; Cash reimbursements must be paid to the Agent upon delivery of the  goods purchased for the Client.&nbsp; For reimbursements made by credit card,  the Agent will enter the exact amount to be reimbursed in place of the estimated reimbursement amount upon marking the Mission as Accomplished.&nbsp; The Client will  have the opportunity to view, and if necessary, amend this amount when  confirming the Mission&nbsp; as accomplished. Agents are encouraged to show the  receipt(s) resulting from any  purchases to the Client upon delivery and  to maintain posession of any  such receipts.</p>
<p>Agents who accept a Mission requiring them to spend their own money  acknowledge that the Company makes no guarantee that these expenditures  will be repaid and that it is the Agent&rsquo;s own responsibility to seek the  recoupment of these expenditures from the Client.&nbsp;</p>
<p>d) Awarding a Mission to an Agent</p>
<p>When posting a Mission with a specified Reward, the Client may indicate their desire to select the Agent who runs their Mission or elect to automatically award the Mission to the first  Agent to accept that Mission (Missions for which a Client has elected to accept offers from Agents cannot be automatically awarded).&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the Client elects to automatically award the Mission to the first Agent to accept that Mission, the Client will have to enter their credit card and billing information before posting the Mission.&nbsp; By posting a Mission with this option selected, the Client agrees to enter  into a formal business agreement with whatever Agent accepts that  Mission, and to pay that Agent the promised Reward and any applicable  Reimbursements, if and when the Mission is accomplished.&nbsp; When the Mission is accepted by an Agent, the Client  will be notified via e-mail but  will not have any opportunity to accept or refuse the choice of Agent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the Client elects to accept offers from Agents, or if the Client  indicates that they would like the opportunity to select their Agent,  the Client will have the opportunity to accept or refuse any particular  Agent on the basis of price offered or any other factors, such as the  Agent&rsquo;s rating. In this case, the Client will enter their credit card and billing information upon accepting Agent's offer to run a Mission.&nbsp; By accepting the Agent's offer, the Client agrees to enter into a  formal business agreement with that Agent, and to pay that Agent the  promised Reward and any applicable Reimbursements, if and when the  Mission is accomplished.</p>
<p>e) Accepting or Making an Offer for a Mission</p>
<p>By accepting or making an offer to complete a Mission, the Agent agrees to enter into a   business agreement with the  Client and to perform the Mission   described, if it is awarded to him or her.&nbsp; Agents should not accept any Mission that they believe is   illegal.&nbsp; If you believe a Client has posted an illegal  Mission, please    notify  the   Company immediately.</p>
<p>Once an Agent is awarded a Mission, either by accepting it or by   having his or her offer accepted by a Client, the Agent   is responsible for   the completion of that   Mission before it becomes due, as indicated by   the Client at the time of   posting.&nbsp; Failure to accomplish accepted   Missions may result in an Agent's suspension from use of the Services.</p>
<p>f) Mission Accomplished</p>
<p>Upon completing a Mission, the Agent will mark the Mission as  &ldquo;Accomplished.&rdquo; If the Mission required the Agent to spend his or her  own money, the Agent will also indicate the exact  amount of the Reimbursement owed by the Client.&nbsp; Any Mission that has  been awarded to an Agent and has not been marked as either  &ldquo;Accomplished&rdquo; or &ldquo;Failed&rdquo; by an Agent twenty-four (24) hours after it  was due, as indicated by the Client at the time of posting, will  automatically be marked as &ldquo;Accomplished.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this case, if the Mission  required the Agent to spend his or her own money,  the Reimbursement amount will be considered equal to the amount  estimated by the Client.</p>
<p>Once the Mission is marked as &ldquo;Accomplished,&rdquo; the Client will receive  an e-mail asking him or her to confirm the Mission&rsquo;s status as  &ldquo;Accomplished&rdquo; or to mark it as &ldquo;Failed.&rdquo; From the time the Mission is  initially marked as &ldquo;Accomplished,&rdquo; the Client will have forty-eight  (48) hours to confirm the Mission&rsquo;s status as &ldquo;Accomplished&rdquo; and to  confirm or amend the Reimbursement amount owed to the Agent, if applicable, or to  mark it as &ldquo;Failed.&rdquo;&nbsp; After this forty-eight (48) hour period, the  Mission will automatically be confirmed as &ldquo;Accomplished,&rdquo; and the  Reimbursement amount will be considered equal to that indicated by the  Agent or, if the Agent has not indicated any amount, to that estimated  by the Client at the time of posting.</p>
<p>A Mission is considered Accomplished only when it is confirmed as  &ldquo;Accomplished,&rdquo; either by the Client or automatically as a result of the  Client&rsquo;s inaction as described above.&nbsp; The Client may confirm the  Mission as &ldquo;Accomplished&rdquo; at any time, without waiting for the Agent to  do so first.&nbsp; This will also result in the Mission being considered  Accomplished.</p>
<p>Once a Mission has been confirmed as &ldquo;Accomplished,&rdquo; the Client&rsquo;s  credit card will be charged the total amount of the Reward, the total  amount of the Reimbursements (if applicable), and the Company&rsquo;s fee.&nbsp;  Once the Client&rsquo;s credit card has been charged, the Reward and any Reimbursements (if applicable), will be sent to the Agent's university e-mail address via PayPal e-mail money transfer .</p>
<p>The Company  expressly disclaims any liability and you agree to  hold the  Company  harmless for any claims arising out of payments  transfers.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. DISPUTES</strong></p>
<p>Once a Mission is confirmed as &ldquo;Accomplished,&rdquo; either by the Client or automatically, or marked as &ldquo;Failed&rdquo; by the Client, its status is considered final.&nbsp; Clients are not charged nor are Agent paid for Failed Missions.&nbsp; Clients are charged, and Agents are paid for Accomplished Missions.&nbsp; The Company has no power or responsibility to seek or retrieve money from either party.</p>
<p>If a Client or Agent wishes to dispute the final status of a Mission, the Company will endeavor to put the two parties in direct communication, but makes no guarantees that it will be able to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company encourages both parties to resolve any dispute through direct communication, but is not involved in the dispute process itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the Client and Agent resolve their dispute and both parties wish to change the status of the Mission and make the corresponding transfers of funds, they may inform the Company who will help them to do so.</p>
<p>If the dispute is not resolved, the Company cannot and will not intervene or dictate a resolution.&nbsp; The Company cannot force a Client to pay for a Mission that he or she has marked as &ldquo;Failed,&rdquo; nor can it recover a payment made to an Agent once a Mission has been confirmed as &ldquo;Accomplished.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>6. MISSION FEEDBACK</strong></p>
<p>After the completion of a Mission, Clients and Agents may rate and leave comments about one another.&nbsp; The rating system on the Web Site is meant to be a   guide for other users and to help the Company control the quality of the   Services it provides.&nbsp; Please note that multiple negative ratings are   grounds for termination of a user&rsquo;s account.&nbsp; Agents may not leave   negative feedback in an attempt to procure more money, nor may Clients   leave negative feedback in an attempt to procure further services from   an Agent.&nbsp; No retaliatory feedback is allowed against another user for   any reason.&nbsp; The Company reserves the right to remove any unjustified,   offensive or unwarranted feedback in its sole discretion.</p>

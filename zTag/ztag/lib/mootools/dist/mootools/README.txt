in this folder, is uncompressed. For production website, you
should check out a compressed version at http://www.mootools.net

If you use the Core Builder, be sure to select these components:

- Class
- Element
- Request (can be left out if you don't need dynamic XML loading)

(required components for those will automatically be selected)

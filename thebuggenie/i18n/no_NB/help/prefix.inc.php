If you specify a prefix for one of your projects, every issue reported for that project will have that prefix in front of the issue number.<br>
<br>
You can use anything as a prefix, but for your own convenience, you should keep it short.<br>
<br>
<b>An example</b><br>
Say you have three projects, <i>Project A</i>, <i>Project B</i> and <i>Project C</i>. You would then want to prefix your projects like this:<br>
<ul>
<li>Project A has prefix <b>PA</b></li>
<li>Project B has prefix <b>PB</b></li>
<li>Project C has prefix <b>PC</b></li>
</ul>
When the first issue is reported for <i>Project A</i>, the issue number for that issue will then be <b>PA-1</b>. The next issue will be called <b>PA-2</b>. The first issue reported for <i>Project B</i> will of course be named <b>PB-1</b>, and the next will be numbered accordingly - <b>PB-2</b>.<br>
<br>
By using a prefix for your projects, you can then easily see - just by looking at the issue number - what project that issue affects.<br>
<br>
If you don't want to use a prefix, every issue will be numbered sequentially. The first issue reported will be numbered <b>#1</b>, the next will be numbered <b>#2</b> - regardless of which project it affects. You can of course have one project with prefix, and one without - mix and match as you please.

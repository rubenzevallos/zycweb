<div style="padding: 2px;"><b>What is a "component"?</b><br>
One piece of software is usually divided into several "sub-pieces", called "components". By splitting software into these components, one developer or
one team of developers can focus on one area of the software, while other developers can focus on other areas.<br>
<br>
If you select the correct component, chances are bigger that the correct developer(s) will be notified immediately, which increases your chances that
your issue will be looked into.<br> 
<br>
<b>How do I know which component to choose?</b><br>
The components usually have self-explanatory names, such as "menu", "printing", etc - this varies depending on the type of software you are using, and 
could be anything. Look for a component that looks like it fits the area you are reporting an issue for. <i>If you cannot find the correct component</i>, 
there is usually a "general" or "unknown" component - pick that one.<br>

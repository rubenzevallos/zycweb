<b>Setting up a project</b><br>
Before you can report issues, you need to have at least one edition in your project. If you have several editions of your project, this is where you
set it up. If you only have one, don't worry - we'll call it something generic.<br>
<br>
If you're not there already, click the <span style="display: float;"><img src="themes/oxygen/cfg_icon_projects.png">&nbsp;<b>Manage projects</b></span> link,
then click the <span style="display: float;"><img src="themes/oxygen/cfg_icon_projecteditionsbuilds.png">&nbsp;<b>Editions, builds &amp; components</b></span> link.<br>
<br>
<b>Editions, builds &amp; components</b><br>
A list of all your editions will be displayed at the top left, and a list of all your components will be displayed at the top right.<br>
<br>
<b>Creating a new edition</b><br>
To create a new edition, enter the edition name in the "Add a new edition" name field, and press the plus-button to the right of the field to add it.
The edition will appear in the list - click its name. On the new page you get to, you can edit the editions information, which will appear in the same 
places as the information for projects. The edition also have several settings, which does the same as the corresponding settings for projects. (read 
more about these settings in the "setting up a project" section).<br>
<br>
<b>IMPORTANT: Remember to give other users access to the project.</b><br>Access will be given to the group you are in, but remember to grant access to
other groups or users as well.<br>
<br>
<b>Creating a new component and assigning it to an edition</b><br>
There are two ways to create components. You can create them directly from the edition and components overview page that you saw at the beginning of 
this section, or on the edition settings page. Adding a component on the edition settings page automatically adds it to the edition as well. If you add
it on the edition and components overview page, you must also add it to an edition before it's available to users. You can add it by going to the 
edition settings page (click the edition name on the edition and components overview page) and click the "Add this" link next to the component name.<br>

<b>IMPORTANT: Remember to give other users access to the project.</b><br>Access will be given to the group you are in, but remember to grant access to
other groups or users as well.<br>

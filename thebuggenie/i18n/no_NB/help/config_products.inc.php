<b>Basic overview of a project</b><br>
To better get an understanding of how a project is made up, let's start with an example project - we'll call it <i>"My Operating System"</i>. Cool, an operating system.<br>
<i>"My Operating System"</i> comes in several different editions: <i>"Ultimate edition"</i>, <i>"Home edition"</i> and so on. Let's use these two as examples.<br>
<br>
<i>"My Operating System"</i> is made up of several components, such as <i>"Kernel"</i>, <i>"Drivers"</i>, <i>"Applications"</i> and maybe many more. In addition, the <i>"Ultimate Edition"</i> also has an <i>"Extra applications"</i> component, which is not available in the <i>"Home Edition"</i>. This makes it easier for Home users. Sure. Aaanyway - this is what you've decided.<br>
<br>
Still with us? <b>Great!</b> Let's continue.<br>
<br>
<b>Builds</b><br>
As you develop <i>"My Operating System"</i>, you will need to release some versions here and there, just to check how everything works. Maybe you have impatient customers, eager to check out the progress made since yesterday. These "versions" are called "builds".<br>
<br>
A build has a version number, which tells you where in the cycle that build was released.<br>
<br>
<b>What's needed for a project?</b><br>
As you can see above, BUGS 2 supports all these parts. This is what's needed to report issues:
<ul>
	<li>One or more projects</li>
	<li>Projects must have at least one edition</li>
	<li>The edition must have at least one component</li>
	<li>The edition must have at least one release (build)</li>
</ul> 
So, that's is all fine and dandy - but how do you set up all this stuff?<br>
